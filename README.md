## THE MACHINE LEARNING RAP

**INTRO:**

Aw shit

You know what it is.  Or maybe you don’t.  Well allow me to classify this for you.

It’s Machine Learning time with MC-ML!

**VERSE:**

First you got a dataset  
and look what you get  
You gotta a buncha rows, columns,  
and some headers I bet  


Before we go through it  
and we build a machine  
We gotta make sure your data’s  
sparkling clean  


Randomize the rows before you  
do the next step  
Split your cleaned up data  
into training and test


Now scale that data,  
if you know what I mean  
Gonna normalize it  
for an unbiased machine


Now we choose an algorithm  
to predict or classify  
Both use regression, f(x) = y  


If you classify,  
make sure your classes are equal  
If one is bigger than the other then your accuracy is worthless  
That doesn’t rhyme, but it’s still very important  


Regularization  
is the dopest shit  
It limits overtraining  
so we don’t overfit  


Now score that model,  
gotta see if it works  
Count the true and false positives  
to see what it’s worth  


You slide a loss function  
then it changes them all  
Cause your TP rises  
but your TN falls  


Cross-validate,  
don’t be a sucka   
Same set, different tests,  
10 times muthaf***a  

-10-

Now excuse me  
If I'm gettin too deep  
We got a neural network here  
With parameter sweeps  


We can approximate any  
continuous function  
Back propagate  
Change the weights for production  


Yann Lecun  
And Ian Goodfellow  
They call me big boss  
Cause my hacks so ghetto  


BREAKDOWN

Yeah, I work for a startup mutha**a!  
They got a fridge full of cheese motha**a!
