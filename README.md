## THE MACHINE LEARNING RAP

**INTRO:**

Aw shit

You know what it is.  Or maybe you don’t.  Well allow me to classify this for you.

It’s Machine Learning time with MC ML!

VERSE:

First you got a dataset and look what you get

You gotta a buncha rows, columns, and some headers I bet

Before we

Go through it and we build a machine

We gotta

Make sure your data’s sparkling clean

Randomize the rows before you do the next step
Split your cleaned up data into training and test

Now scale that data, if you know what I mean
Gonna minimize it for an unbiased machine

Now we choose an algorithm predict or classify
Both use regression, f(x) = y

If you classify, make sure your classes are equal
If one is bigger than the other then your accuracy is worthless
That doesn’t rhyme, but it’s still very important

Regularization is the dopest shit
It limits overtraining so we don’t overfit

Now score that model, gotta see if it works
Count the true and false positives to see what it’s worth

You slide a loss function then it changes them all
Cause your TP rises but your TN falls

Cross-validate, don’t be a sucka
Same set, different tests, 10 times muthaf***a
